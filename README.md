** Password Generator **
3.0

This builds a stronger password by building an array of characters, then passing a strong crypto (if available) through a Math.random operation that chooses the characters at random from the array, loop it though the charAt function to generate an 11 character random password.

Per request i've built a dialogue into the window that allows the user to specify the length and type of characters that they want in their password.
